# Timestamp converter

I made a little timestamp converter which will allow you to easily put in a date
and time and a discord format and it will convert your set date and time into 
the timestamp format and it will put the timestamp with your chosen format into your clipboard.


## Installation

Install python and run this command in command prompt (or download the finished project as an executable):
```bash
  pip install pyperclip
```
Once finished, you can just open the python file and you should be good to go.
